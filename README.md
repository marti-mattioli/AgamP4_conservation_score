# AgamP4 conservation score

Scripts used for generating, processing and fetching the genome conservation score (Cs) for _Anopheles gambiae_ (AgamP4) genome.

Publication: https://doi.org/10.3390/insects12020097

## Create and activate Conda environment
Make sure you have Conda installed on your system beforehand. You can read more about how to install it here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install

First, clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/nkran/AgamP4_conservation_score.git
cd AgamP4_conservation_score/
```

Create an environment and install all needed dependencies:
```
conda create --name AgamP4-Cs python=3.11
conda activate AgamP4-Cs
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download the dataset

To download the dataset you can use the following command:
```
python fetch_score.py -m download 
```
You can also download the dataset manually from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4304586. Please make sure you place the downloaded file in the `data/` folder.

## Fetch conservation score (Cs)
Extraction of values from the dataset can be done by using `fetch_score.py`

### Usage
```
usage: fetch_score.py [-h] [-m {download,extract}] [-r REGION]
                      [-a {Cs,score,snp_density,stack,stack_norm,phyloP}]
                      [-o OUTPUT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m {download,extract}, --mode {download,extract}
                        Mode (download, extract)
  -r REGION, --region REGION
                        Genomic region (ie. 2R:48714500-48714700)
  -a {Cs,score,snp_density,stack,stack_norm,phyloP}, --array {Cs,score,snp_density,stack,stack_norm,phyloP}
                        Name of the array to access. (Cs, score, snp_density,
                        stack, stack_norm, phyloP)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Name of the output file where data will be saved
```

### Storage
There are several different results saved in the HDF5 file.
- `stack` – the array consists of 21 rows representing stacked intervals with identity scores from CNEr (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CNEr.html) scans for each species analysed in the study. Order of reference genomes in the array is defined under ‘genomes’ attribute of the array. ‘species’ attribute contains the ordered list of species names. Columns represent positions in the chromosomes.

- `stack_norm` – copy of the stack array where each row with was normalised by multiplying the row contents with the phylogenetic distance between AgamP4 genome and the genome belonging to the row.

- `snp_density` – the array consists of 20bp sliding window of SNP density obtained from Ag1000g phase 2 dataset (https://www.malariagen.net/projects/ag1000g).

- `score` – the array with averaged scores across all 21 genomes where each row contains values from each step in the process of calculating the final conservation score. Row descriptions are stored under ‘rows’ attribute of the array.

- `phyloP` - phyloP scores calculated for the multiple genomes alignment using PHAST (http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/) 

- `Cs` – the array with final conservation score presented in the paper

### Examples

Cs can be extracted with `--mode extract` argument.

```
python fetch_score.py -m extract -r 2R:48714500-48714700 -a Cs -o results.tsv
```

Extracted values will be saved in a tab separated file specified with `-o` argument (ie. `results.tsv`).
